I'm making [The Contraption Company](https://github.com/contraptionco), an indie product studio crafting tools that help people work online. There, I focus most of my time making [Postcard](https://postcard.page)  and [Bookle](https://www.booklet.community). I'm fascinated by how the Internet affects labor, and I seek to leverage technology to help people love their work.
