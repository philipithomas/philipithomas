I'm making [The Contraption Company](https://github.com/contraptionco), an indie product studio crafting tools that help people work online. There, I focus most of my time on [Postcard](https://postcard.page) - a personal website + newsletter tool to help you stay in touch with or without social media. I'm fascinated by how the Internet affects labor, and I seek to leverage technology to help people love their work.

My website is [philipithomas.com](https://www.philipithomas.com), and contact me at [mail@philipithomas.com](mailto:mail@philipithomas.com)
