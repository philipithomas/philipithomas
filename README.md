I'm making [The Contraption Company](https://github.com/contraptionco), an indie product studio making tools for online work. There, I focus most of my time making [Booklet](https://www.booklet.group). I'm fascinated by how the Internet affects labor, and I seek to leverage technology to help people love their work.
