I'm the founder of [The Contraption Company](https://github.com/contraptionco), a product studio crafting tools that help people work online. I'm fascinated by how technology and the internet affect work and labor.

In the past, I founded [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlightwork) - an early remote work company helping software engineers, which was acquired and continues to operate. I also founded [Staffjoy](https://github.com/staffjoy), a startup that built scheduling tools force for app-based workforces, which is now a popular open-source project. I studied Physics and Systems Engineering at WashU, and was a Y Combinator Fellow. I've worked with companies like Webflow (building their marketplace), Trusted Health (building Works), OpenDNS (building security for distributed workforces), and Dawn Health (as an advisor). In my free time, I like to travel and explore urban culture through cafes.
